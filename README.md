# Dazling Dark

Here is the VS Code theme that I customized for my use . I like dark themes so it's dark

I took inspiration from the [Coder Coder](https://github.com/thecodercoder/codercoder-dark-theme)

ðŸ’¥ If you like this theme and would like to support me making cool stuff on here and YouTube, you can [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/MunavvarSinan) on GitHub!

Will be maintaining this as I have time
